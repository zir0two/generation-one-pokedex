# generation-one-pokedex

Hello!

Welcome to my rendition of the classic Pokedex!

This program will get updated as I learn more skills. 

The main goal of this program is for a user to use the main interface of the Pokedex to see all the information 
of the original 151 Pokemon. There is not much about it since it is like an encyclopedia for Pokemon, but if you want 
to know what a Pokedex can tell about a Pokemon, then you came to the right place.
